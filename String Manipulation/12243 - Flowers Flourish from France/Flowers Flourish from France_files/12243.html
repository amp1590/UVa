Fiona has always loved poetry, and recently she discovered a fascinating 
poetical form. <span class="textit">Tautograms</span> are a special case of alliteration, 
which is the occurrence of the same letter at the beginning of adjacent 
words. In particular, a sentence is a tautogram if all of its words 
start with the same letter. 

</p><p>
For instance, the following sentences are tautograms: 

</p><p>

</p><p>
<br>

</p><ul>
<li>Flowers Flourish from France 
</li>
<li>Sam Simmonds speaks softly 
</li>
<li>Peter pIckEd pePPers 
</li>
<li>truly tautograms triumph 
</li>
</ul>

<p>

Fiona wants to dazzle her boyfriend with a romantic letter full of this 
kind of sentences. Please help Fiona to check if each sentence she 
wrote down is a tautogram or not.

<p>
Each test case is given in a single line that contains a sentence. A 
sentence consists of a sequence of at most 50 words separated by 
single spaces. A word is a sequence of at most 20 contiguous uppercase 
and lowercase letters from the English alphabet. A word contains at 
least one letter and a sentence contains at least one word. 

</p><p>
The last test case is followed by a line containing only a single 
character `<code>*</code>' (asterisk).

Output</a>&nbsp;</font>
</h2>

<p>
For each test case output a single line containing an uppercase 
`<tt>Y</tt>' if the sentence is a tautogram, or an uppercase 
`<tt>N</tt>' otherwise.
